## Sad News

This Project was only left in fragments due the cyberattack on the haw hamburg.
The whole deployment, some basic configurations and testing files could not have been saved.

Files that need to be redone:

    deployment/
        minikube/  
            deployment_backend.yaml
            service.yaml
        deployment.yaml
        nginx.conf

    src/app/
        model/
            config.ts
            user.ts
        service/config/
            alerting.service.spec.ts
        app.component.spec.ts
        styles/
            variables.scss
        index.html
        polyfills.ts
    
    angular.json

    Dockerfile

## Github migration

As you can see, this project was stored in Gitlab during the attack. 
Therefore the old automated testing and deployment processes do not work anymore.
